# Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product

## MUST

* I can use the app on Android and iOS.
* I can close the app and re-open it without losing state.
* I can sync the state to a server.
* I can add, remove and update "notes".
* I can write Markdown (including rich text entities) in my "notes".
* I can view my notes in list format.
* I can view the full content of a note, individually.

## COULD

* I can use the app on web.
* I can collaborate on a "note" in real-time.
* I can add comments to a "note".

# Phase 2: Long Term Objectives

## MUST

* I can associate a state with each "note".
* I can easily add a "note" to an "inbox" (implemented as a state).
* I can filter notes by state.
* I will always be encouraged to empty my inbox before doing anything else.
* The app can send me notifications to suggest that I review "notes" on a schedule.
  * This could adopt a GTD-style opinionated enforcement:
    * Review "Active/Next" every day
    * Review "Soon" once week
    * Review "Someday/Maybe" once a month
    * Review active projects once a week?
  * Thic could be configurable.
* I can create "projects" which track "notes" over time.
* The app will encourage me to add a next action, whenever there is none, for all active projects.
* I can declare a "note" as a dependency of another "note".

## SHOULD

* I can search notes.
* I can view my notes (by project?) in a graph format.
  * (This is intended to help me review dependencies and progress.)
